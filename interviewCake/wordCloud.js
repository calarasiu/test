// You want to build a word cloud, an infographic where the size of a word corresponds to how often it appears in the body of text.

// To do this, you'll need data. Write code that takes a long string and builds its word cloud data in a dictionary â†´ , where the keys are words and the values are the number of times the words occurred.

// Think about capitalized words. For example, look at these sentences:

//   'After beating the eggs, Dana read the next step:'
// 'Add milk and eggs, then add flour and sugar.'
// What do we want to do with "After", "Dana", and "add"? In this example, your final dictionary should include one "Add" or "add" with a value of 22. Make reasonable (not necessarily perfect) decisions about cases like "After" and "Dana".

// Assume the input will only contain words and standard punctuation.
